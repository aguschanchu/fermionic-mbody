# fermionic_mbody: High-Performance M-body Reduced Density Matrix Computation

`fermionic_mbody` is a Python library designed for the efficient computation of M-body Reduced Density Matrices (M-RDMs) in fermionic systems. It provides tools to build fermionic bases, generate the sparse 4-tensor RDM generators, and compute the RDMs for specific quantum states.

## Key Features

*   **FixedBasis Generation:** Robust handling of fermionic bases, including restrictions to specific particle numbers (N) and paired subspaces.
*   **Optimized RDM Generation:** Efficient generation of the sparse RDM generator tensors ($T$) using multiprocessing and Numba acceleration.
*   **Direct RDM Computation:** Includes `rho_m_direct`, which calculates the M-RDM for a given state vector $|\Psi\rangle$ without explicitly building the full 4-tensor generator, offering significant performance benefits.
*   **Specialized Blocks:** Functions to generate specific blocks relevant for pairing Hamiltonians (e.g., `rho_2_kkbar_gen`).
*   **Density Matrix Contraction:** The `rho_m` helper efficiently contracts the generator tensors with kets, density matrices, or batches thereof.

## Installation

The library relies on standard scientific Python packages (`numpy`, `scipy`, `sparse`, `tqdm`) and `openfermion`. Numba is highly recommended for performance acceleration. Python 3.10+ is recommended.

```bash
pip install numpy scipy sparse tqdm openfermion numba
# To install fermionic_mbody (e.g., from source)
# pip install .
